# Fullstack real time chat application

On frontend side I used the following technologies:

-   ReactJS,
-   TypeScript,
-   Vite to build an run the project,
-   Zustand for state management,
-   Tailwindcss with DaisyUI for styling the app
-   Axios and Socket.io to get data in real time from server

On backend side I used the following technologies:

-   NodeJS,
-   Express,
-   Mongoose to create database schemas and connect to mongodb database,
-   Cloudinary to store images,
-   Socket.io to communicate in real time with client side

In order to run this locally you need:

1. Clone the project
2. Run `npm install` on client and server folders
3. Run `npm run start` on client folder and server folder

Then go to the browser and go to the following [http://localhost:5714/](http://localhost:5714/) url.

Here you can find a live version of the app: [https://octa-realtime-chat.onrender.com/](https://octa-realtime-chat.onrender.com/)
